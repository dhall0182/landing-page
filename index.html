                MY ENGINEERING STORY SO FAR
            </h3>
            <p id="about-story-message">
                Like many other developers, my journey did not begin in programming.
                My first love in life was math and
                physics. The initial plan was to become a research professor.
                Those plans changed, however, when I began my family. It was then that I decided to turn my hobby of
                coding into a future career.
                After graduating with a math degree, I decided to take the graduate school route.
                I know this isn't the most common thing in software engineering, but I wanted to shore up some
                weaknesses that I believed that I had from being self-taught.
                I needed to develop my project management skills and I wanted to become better aquainted with different
                languages. My master's degree program allowed me to do so.
                Since graduating I have worked hard to continue being a life-long learner - something that I believe is
                a invaluable skill for Software Engineers.

                For now, there isn't much to my portfolio. Don't worry though, I am working on adding new projects
                everyday. Check back soon for updates!<br><br>
                Here is a link to my <a href="https://github.com/dhall0182">GitHub</a> page as well. It will contain
                some of the projects that I
                completed in my graduate program that includes desktop and mobile applications.
